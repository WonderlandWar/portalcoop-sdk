Welcome:

Welcome to Portal: Cooperative, the origins of this mod goes back to 2020 for a Portal mod named Portal: Multiplayer. The first 3 maps in the 2 player map set originated from my custom Portal: Multiplayer maps. I realized later on that creating multiplayer maps for this mod was too difficult because of how buggy it is so I let these maps gather in the dust for years only updating them occasionally. In Portal's gamepad UI update, the bug that crashed the game when you were close to a Portal was fixed, allowing me to make maps for a little less buggy version of Portal: Multiplayer. Later on, I realized that creating a Portal Cooperative mod was necessary because midigating the bugs wasn't satisfactory as fixing the bugs was a much better solution and it let me add features that wouldn't be possible in a standalone map pack.

Introduction:

This room was setup so that players can see each other from their own relaxation vault. The portals that the players exit through are facing each other to immediately ensure that both of the players' goal is to meet each other.

Pacing:

The first 2 puzzles start from 1 set of portals only to 2 sets of portals. This helps the pacing by introducing another portal set's existence in a puzzle environment so that when players get the portalgun in the 3rd level, players aren't completely overwhelmed by another portal set's existence in a more complicated puzzle.

Portalgun Puzzle:

This puzzle was difficult to create as most rotating portalgun puzzles are. The grates where the buttons were located that surrounded the flooring originally didn't exist, which prompted some playtesters to solve the puzzle by having 1 player stay at the cleansers with the box while the other player quickly rushed to press both buttons in time. This was an incorrect solution that the grates now prevent.

Fling Area Purpose:

This fling area was originally in the next map due to the fact that it used to be the first map. It's now used as a simple puzzle after players acquire the portalgun, but its main purpose is to ensure that both players have a portalgun when they reach the exit.

Energy Ball Training:

In earlier versions of Portal: Cooperative, this was the first test chamber because of how simple it is. It's now used to introduce energy balls for the mod in a way that trains players on using the energy ball together.

Original Entrances:

In the original versions of each test chamber entrance, there would be a button here that would activate a pedestal right in front of it that delivers a portalgun, this was because the Portal: Multiplayer mod only spawned you with the blue portalgun, this was a slow process however. When this map pack was originally moved to Portal, the portalgun spawned using map logic in a similar way you spawn with weapons in Half-Life 2 while also using a timer to constantly make your portalgun able to shoot both portals. In Portal: Cooperative, the portalgun spawn is now controlled by the spawnpoints themselves which are easy to use for custom map makers.

Old Puzzle:

In the original version of this test chamber, the launcher was on this side of the test chamber, the glass dividing the test chamber didn't exist and there was a button somewhere under this node that opened doors which blocked the energy ball from the portal surface for your partner to use. This was a very boring and underwhelming puzzle because it only consisted of doing an infinite fling and delivering the ball to your partner while you stand on a button. The difficulty of this puzzle also didn't increase from the previous puzzle very much. With this new version, having a player direct the ball to you, and you directing it back at them proved to be more interesting and is conceptually harder than redirecting the ball only once.

Old Layout 1:

Originally this floor was cut allowing players to fling, but this was a very awkward cut and it hindered movement. The fling pit below allows players to fling easier and it's more clear that it's a fling pit. Originally the ceiling of the new fling pit was concrete, but it made some playtesters confused because they thought they had to do an infinite fling, making it metal solved this problem.

Working Around Bugs:

In the very first iteration of this map, this piston was pushed out about half as much as it is right now and the wall this piston is attached to wasn't pushed back like it is now. In Portal's multiplayer, there is a very bad bug that would sometimes cancel or reduce momentum that players got from flinging, so we pushed the piston out like how it is now so players could reach the other side easier. Because this bug was fixed in Portal: Cooperative, it allowed us to push the wall back, creating more space. This is a perfect example of what we had to work with in Portal's multiplayer mode, to midigate the effects of bugs instead of outright fixing them.

Old Layout 2:
In the original layout, the door here was actually on the bottom and it would lead to a platform rising up to this node. This was problematic because it got in the way of players flinging and players would inevitably fall in the pit. The stairs leading up to this door didn't exist either. This new layout has 3 advantages, it fixed the problem of players falling down the pit and the new layout adds the glass which lets both players see the turret while also letting the other player watch the other's actions, it also made the door more recognizable.

Ping Marker:

The Ping Marker or Ping Tool is based off of the old style pinging in Portal 2. When you are not looking at an pingable object, it creates a crosshair, but if it pingable, it will glow. Originally these doors weren't pingable because the door models don't have a collision model, while the actual collision of the doors is from the door entity itself. So how do we make the door model glow? When you ping the door entity, the ping marker scans through every pingable object in the entity index and checks if the pingable object is parented to the door. If the pingable object is parented to the door, it will glow. This also includes if the pingable object is parented to something, if the object is parented to something, the ping marker scans through every pingable object in the entity index and sees if that object is parented and matches the pingable object's parent you pinged, if all that checks out, it will glow.

Old Goo:

This section went through many iterations before we settled on this. The first iteration didn't have the cleanser and the left platform moved up and down. There were a few problems with this iteration, 1 player could get the box and get both boxes by using the first box and the platform moving up and down proved to be annoying. The next iteration included the cleanser with the timed button, this solved players being able to singlehandedly make it through to get the box. The moving platform was still kept however and it proved to be more annoying than anything else, so the platform is now stationary.

Last Test:

Because this is the last test chamber, it needed to be somewhat unique. Having a player catch a cube in mid-air is climatic for both players involved because the timer creates pressure and having a player achieve a goal while flying in mid-air is exciting.

Platform Ride:

This platform ride was inspired by Portal's last test chamber platform ride, having players help each other on opposite sides while under time pressure is also another way to build up to an event, such as the upcoming fire pit. The platforms positioned on opposite sides and having the players activate the platforms with each others' help while being on opposite sides helped players understand that they need to be on 2 separate platforms.

Sensor Doors:

These doors were made so players cannot proceed without another. They also prohibit players from cheesing the puzzle by using a previous area. The original idea for a door that required both players present to enter were double doors that would unlock when both players are in a trigger, but the problem with this design was that there is no indication of when you can actually open the door, so we switched to sensor doors.

Portal Coop Formula:

Portal: Cooperative's formula is supposed to be similar to Portal's, completing the testing sequence and then escaping. While Portal: Cooperative is basically just a mod with a map pack in it, it still has a sequence of events without necessarily having a complex story.

Escape Puzzles:

The escape puzzles in Portal: Cooperative needed to require both players to solve the puzzles together, otherwise it wouldn't be fun for the player that did nothing while the other person solves the puzzle and cooperation was the main focus of this mod. The puzzles weren't easy to create because Behind The Scenes in Portal dont't have testing elements that test chambers do so the escape puzzles mainly required the 1st player to save portals 2nd player has to direct the 1st player somewhere else.

Escape Filler:

Even though most escape puzzles required cooperation, not all of them could because extra filler was necessary and there are very limited amount of coop puzzles you can create with portals and pistons only. Another advantage to this is that it doesn't always feel super convenient that every single room requires both players, making it feel less staged.

Puzzle Design:

Most escape puzzles were created separately and then stitched together. This was because we knew the limitations on how many puzzles we can create and we wanted to get those done as soon as possible. It also let us focus on the puzzles themselves rather than how separate sections will fit together, which wasn't as important as the puzzles are.

Respawning:

The intent of this puzzle was for both players grab the turrets at the same time. An unfortunate side effect of respawning which this mod didn't take into account, is that players can do something successfully and respawn, such as taking out one turret, dying, and respawning. Players progressing through a level by doing something that causes them to inevitably die is unsatisfactory.

Rocket Turret:

The rocket turrets in Portal only have their enemy set to the first player. In singleplayer, this is works fine, but in multiplayer, it means that only 1 player will be targetted. So how do we fix this? In Half-Life 2, NPCs have a system to find their "bestenemy", which usually just means the closest enemy and the NPC must be able to know that the enemy exists. We moved this bestenemy system to the rocket turret and now it can target all players and other NPCs automatically. It originally had a proper viewcone, but this was inconsistent with how the rocket turret functions in Portal, so this was undone.

Rocket Turret Puzzle:

This room was very difficult to create to achieve proper player guidance. If you've played earlier versions of the mod, you may have had difficulty realizing that the solution was to blow up the observation room window with the rocket. The new changes include cameras that mark portal placement, a new glass window that players must blow up before entering the other section of the test chamber, and a new location for the observation room window. The old observation room placement was just off to the corner, making it seem insignificant. The purpose of the new glass is to make players immediately believe that this is a rocket redirection puzzle and that there's more upcoming ones, preparing them for the observation window glass.

Bossfight:

Because this mod follows Portal's formula, the GLaDOS bossfight was planned. This GLaDOS boss fight is almost identical to Portal's bossfight, except for the obvious changes that made it require cooperation.

Things to do:

Since most of the cooperation required one player to press buttons and the other guides the rocket, we wanted some deviation from that, especially for the player pressing the buttons. 2 of these jumps were made so that this infinite fall area was needed for the fling, this was enough deviation for the player simply pressing buttons.

Neurotoxin Functionality:

Neurotoxin in Portal works differently than it does in Portal: Cooperative. In Portal, the timer is controlled with a console command called "startneurotoxins" and the countdown is controlled by a hidden timer, that hidden timer being the challenge mode time tracker. This was a very poor way of creating neurotoxin because the only player who takes damage is the one who used the command. In Portal: Cooperative, an entity is used instead for the countdown and the damage. The countdown is a global variable which gets constantly networked to the client for the countdown displays. The milliseconds in Portal: Cooperative actually countdown, unlike in Portal where they count up instead.
